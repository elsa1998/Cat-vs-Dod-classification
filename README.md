# Cat-vs-Dog-classification
I use the dataset from kaggle to build a Neural Network model for classification.

## About Data 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/overview

## Goal
Build a model that can identify whether a given image is a cat or a dog. 

## Action
1. Import images & Adjust based on ImageDataGenerator
2. Split the training & testing data
3. Modeling: ResNet, VGG16, VGG19
4. Ensembling

## Final Result
Private Score = 0.14827
